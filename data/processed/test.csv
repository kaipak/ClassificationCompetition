Dude was accused of tankin the WS but hit . 375 w / 0 errors and 5 OF assist @USER @USER #baseball @USER @USER @USER We were talking about this yesterday at work ! @USER @USER @USER It ‚Äô s a crazy topic . Teammates threw the series . He may or may not have known about it . But no debate , didn ‚Äô t take part in it . Highest average of any player that played in that series . Hit only homerun of the entire series . 5 outfield assist . 0 errors . but found guilty #bullcrap @USER @USER @USER Guarantee he didn ‚Äô t participate and my best theory is his teammates took advantage of his illiteracy in some way and made him sign saying he was in on the fix but told him he was just signing for his World Series bonus ( or something ) ."
