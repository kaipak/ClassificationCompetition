I was in Bend , and I walked down to the river at night to take a picture of that cool wave feature they have in the Old Mill District . I set my purse down on a picnic table to take the pic . I eft my purse accidentally on that picnic table and walked back to my condo . 1st time in my entire life I have lost my purse . It had 2k cash , my credit cards , checkbook , even my passport in it . I was sick over it ! I spent 2 hrs looking for my purse on the banks of the river until my phones battery died . I went home the next day after cancelling all my cards , calling the bank , etc . 2 weeks later my purse was mailed back to me anonymously by a Good Samaritan . All my contents were intact . So , just when you think there is no decencyleft in the world , there you go ! I \u2019 m not religious but ... Do unto others as ... , \u201d #Decency #Morality"}
