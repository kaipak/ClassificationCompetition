{"label":"SARCASM","response":"@USER @USER @USER Uneducated about religions--the plural form of that word ? Me thinks you need to reread our chat thus far ;) You're irked because I haven't read Quran cover to cover yet you , while admitting that there is holy text you haven't read claim that Islam incorporates those faiths","context":["Well I just finished reading the Qu \u2018 ran for the second time . Yay me .","@USER @USER I don't think he's reading it because he believes it , I think he's reading it so it can confirm how insanely bullshit it all is .","@USER @USER I was reading it again to bring back to memory what is contained therein since I forgot many things about it .","@USER @USER Oh I prefer to get my questions answered from the primary source or experts .","@USER @USER Well how one would reconcile the contents therein with science ( heliocentrism , evolution ) , what the basis for clear condemnation of unbelievers ( including Christians , Atheists , idol worshippers ) is , how one would reconcile the Qu \u2018 ran with fictional figures like Moses among others","@USER @USER Quran is Pro science . Nothing in it contradicts science . Quran is word of God and science is works of God . They both cant possibly contradict <URL>","@USER @USER @USER Lol , all holy texts I'm aware of contradict not only reach other , but basic science in fundamental ways . You can try to \" make it work \" by using very liberal interpretations , which is an ok start since it tends to somewhat moderate the worst abuses ...","@USER @USER @USER Another self acclaimed expert in all religions ? Have you read Quran cover to cover ? Feel free to ask what you don't understand but to go on to make baseless allegations isn't what gentlemen do","@USER @USER @USER Cover to cover ? No . Name a holy text that you haven't read cover to cover--could that faith be correct ? I also haven't read every pro creationist or astrology argument , but in each car , I've read - enough - :)","@USER @USER @USER All major religions came from the same God . Quran testifies to the truth of them . They are on the same side . It's you who need to read and research to find truth and have a right to reject , Otherwise it's just your blind faith and prejudice based rejection","@USER @USER @USER You didn't answer the question directly , but did so indirectly :) Of course there are holy texts you haven't read ( at all , or in part ) because they all reject the idea that they came from \/ are influenced by \/ are in and some way beholden or sub to the Quran ...","@USER @USER @USER I don't need to read other holy scriptures . I'm not the one rejecting them \ud83d\ude04 It's all from same God YOU are the one rejecting them . You need to learn about something to have a valid reason to reject","@USER @USER @USER No , lol . The claim that it's \" all the same God \" in and of itself invalidates your point :) I've no doubt read more holy text than you , even if I haven't read the Quran cover to cover .","@USER @USER @USER You have no clue what you are talking about . You are running away from the fact that you are uneducated about religions but still reject them based on prejudice"]}

{"label":"NOT_SARCASM","response":"@USER @USER @USER Absolutely ! I \u2019 ve seen entire communities get subsidized for everything !
