It's just not the attitude we should have @USER @USER @USER the issue is that yang supporters do not understand the concept of leftism and the struggle against the ruling class . i'm attacking yang because he fundamentally opposes leftism and supports right libertarian ideals @USER @USER @USER Regardless of how you might label his policies , most Americans would benefit the mist from them . That ‚Äô s the problem I tend to see amongst Bernie supporters , you can ‚Äô t seem to separate ideology from practicality . @USER @USER @USER the problem is in the yang gangs lack of critical analysis of yang's plans . UBI funded by VAT is the poor paying themselves , and also the rich , it's regressive as hell . it also does nothing to benefit those already receiving the bare minimum in SSI / SSDI @USER @USER @USER 40 hour week , 48 weeks , that's a total of another $ 28k between 2 adults . Total projected income after UBI ? 52k . You not even gonna convince yourself that UBI isn't a better option . @USER @USER @USER UBI is great . UBI payed for by taxing consumption and eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism . @USER @USER @USER Again , if you were to criticize UBI , at least get your facts right . UBI does not eliminate any existing welfare programs . @USER @USER @USER allow me to correct my semantic error . UBI is great . YANG'S VERSION OF UBI payed for by taxing consumption and SLOWLY eliminating welfare programs is not great , it is a placative measure to perpetuate the latest stages of capitalism . @USER @USER @USER Also funny how so suddenly people have always had an ideal version of UBI until confronted with Yang ‚Äô s , the only candidate to ever propose the policy and to essentially propel it into mainstream politics . Do you have a problem with the idea of human-centered capitalism ?"
