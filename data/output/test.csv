Akwugo Emejulu . <URL> ‚Äú This has always been the dark heart of white , feminist politics : a jealous guarding of the boundaries of who gets to be a woman , said Prof . Emejulu She cited several examples of white feminists excluding women from ethnic minorities , but began with the earliest . <URL> This continues to the present day , she said . ‚Äú Boundary making is what ‚Äô s crucial here . ‚Äù Therefore , she said , excluding trans people is a way of keeping one ‚Äô s position or status . <URL> Keeping trans women out is , Prof . Sally Hines said , ‚Äú regulating who can belong to a category in order to close down membership , in order to protect the rights of a dominant majority [ white women ] ‚Äù . Prof . Emejulu & Prof . Vanita Sundaram argue that for feminism to really deliver equality & emancipation , it must also focus on problems women face as a result of oppression on basis of factors other than their sex : in particular race , class , sexuality , disability , & gender identity . <URL> Prof . Sundaram : ‚Äú My own research area is violence vs women & girls , and we know that trans women are more vulnerable to violence , harassment , and everyday abuse than other groups of women . So as a feminist and academic , it ‚Äô s my responsibility to advocate for that group of women . ‚Äù ‚Äú So it has to be a feminism that challenges patriarchy and other systems of hierarchy that are used to oppress , gender identity being one of them , ‚Äù Prof . Sundaram . <URL> One of the reasons that a war over trans rights has raged more intensely among feminists in the U . K . than in the US , said Prof . Alison Phipps , is ‚Äú the blame has been put on to the wrong group , and trans people are carrying the can for problems that are not of their making . ‚Äù <URL> The idea that simplifying trans women ‚Äô s legal recognition would lead to increase in attacks in toilets or prisons was unfounded . Prof . Phipps said evidence doesn ‚Äô t show trans women to be anything like as sexually violent as men ... while instead being even more likely to be victims <URL> Painting trans women as predators when they are routinely victims is unjust . And because perceived threat is not the same as actual threat , policies should be ‚Äú based on actual levels of risk , which are low , ‚Äù Prof Phipps ."

My son just graduated and started his 1st real job . He chose from multiple offers well over $ 100k . There is opportunity out there , but you have to open your eyes .Anti-capitalism is popular because people enjoy the feeling of uniting against a common enemy .

Anti-capitalism won't stop until everyone's needs are met . @USER @USER @USER Won't stop until we END CAPITALISM because it's an evil system of wage slavery for the majority of people and it's disgusting vampiric extraction of our life force for the sociopathic neoliberal rich . @USER @USER @USER Yes , it is for real , i have been living it for some years now . There is no option to stop working even for a brief time , and no option to find better employment . It's a setup , done on purpose , to extract our labor , and it's parasitic .
