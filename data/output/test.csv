Eat healthy 2 . Exercise 3 . Therapy 4 . Pills 5 . Get a good nights sleep 6 . Think more positively and the list goes on . Some of these things are easier said than done ( part 1 ) Others are pretty much impossible when you're struggling to make ends meet , when your mom works 2 jobs and she's struggling to make ends meet . How can I eat healthy when I can't afford to eat ? How can I go to therapy when I can barely afford my meds ? And a good night's sleep on this mattress ü§£ . The system around beating depression only works if you have the money for it and if you don't well good luck , but no one wants to talk about that . #depressionfeelslike #depressedandpoor #SickNotWeak"
