Your debating skills amaze me . So I was reading this thread on the EI forum ( I ’ m not proud of myself I was bored ) . Anyway this so called punter / white knight / possibly another escort was pissed because this escort called Rafaella got a 4 star review . Not a bad review as 5 stars is the maximum number of stars that can be given . So he proceeded to slam the reviewer who is a good , honest reviewer a thing which is in short supply these days , especially on a site like Escort Ireland which is renowned for fake reviews . Anyway the usual suspect saps and irate escort alcoholic Nikita UK proceeded to attack this reviewer and other posters who spoke out in his defence . As the night went and started getting into the wee small hours ( well after 3am ) the posts from the white knights and Nikita started getting more abusive , irate and ludicrous . One post in particular by a poster called funboy 71 had me in snorting out loud with laughter at his logic for giving a bad review . Surely this sap cant be serious . According to him a bad review should only be allowed after visiting the escort more than once , ermmm no I don ’ t think so , a bad review can be left after the 1st visit . A bad review after the 3rd visit would have me thinking does this reviewer have a grudge , the 1st 2 reviews sung her praises , a 3rd review that ’ s bad would stink of revenge to me either because the client is pushy , abusive or stalkerish and the escort doesn ’ t want to see that client again .
