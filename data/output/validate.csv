Help me understand . What's your mission in life ? @USER to live as happy and positive life as possible without causing harm and leave this planet better for my children ? And you ? @USER Cool . My mission is quite similar . Question : Where does your sense of morality come from ? @USER Intelligent Designer granted his creation free will ( hope is we love in return ) . Free also = evil . But w / o choice love is not real . @USER suffering and evil are unnecessary if you love some and have infinite attributes @USER No doubt ! But "" All we need is love "" good song but a pipe dream w / o power to forgive & be forgiven . Love is often hard . What then ? @USER if may I as direct , if you had the power to levitate all suffering without any consequences ( inf / attr ) would you use it ?"

Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American , & badly wounded many others , not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime , including recently ... ... hundreds of Iranian protesters . He was already attacking our Embassy , and preparing for additional hits in other locations . Iran has been nothing but problems for many years . Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans , or American assets , we have ... ... targeted 52 Iranian sites ( representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago ) , some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture , and those targets , and Iran itself , WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD . The USA wants no more threats ! @USER Thank you , President Trump . You cannot be more clear than this . We cannot allow America to be pushed around by violent thugs and I ‚Äô m grateful to have a president who will take a REAL stand . And back it up with action if necessary . President . Trump . Does . Not . Bluff ."

I study and read books from various people . And the recurring theme is trust your intuition when you see signs . I used to go crazy looking for signs , and now they come to me very naturally after I just listened and stopped going crazy . <URL> So anyway ... I ‚Äô m sitting at a red light , and I had a thought pop in my head that my brother Eric ‚Äô s Birthday is coming up , ( not til March and it ‚Äô s so like him to remind me way in advance üòÇ ) . And then my arm went a little funny feeling , that ‚Äô s how I know when he ‚Äô s there . And I said in my head ‚Äú Eric are you here ? ‚Äù And I heard ‚Äú look over to your left ‚Äù and boom üí• ... there it was ! A random truck with my brothers name ... hello Eric üíô I always know he ‚Äô s there when I have that feeling , but you know ... sometimes I over analyze it , and I think maybe I just had a shiver or an itch ü§∑ üèº ‚Äç ‚ôÄ Ô∏è but when a sign is right in your face ... trust it ... I know I still have a lot of learning and practicing , but I wanted to jump on and give a little glimmer of hope to those waiting for your signs ."
