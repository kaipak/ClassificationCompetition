0,@USER Ahhh ! So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ‚Äô s Eve !,"['1 . I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù .', '2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani )', '3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything .', '4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy .', '5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap .', '6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù', '7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL>', '8 .

So Trump planned the mournful protesters at the US Embassy on New Year ‚Äô s Eve ! 1 . I ‚Äô ve had a chance to check in with sources , including two US officials who had intelligence briefings after the strike on Suleimani . Here is what I ‚Äô ve learned . According to them , the evidence suggesting there was to be an imminent attack on American targets is ‚Äú razor thin ‚Äù . 2 . In fact the evidence pointing to that came as three discrete facts : a ) A pattern of travel showing Suleimani was in Syria , Lebanon & Iraq to meet with Shia proxies known to have an offensive position to the US . ( As one source said that ‚Äô s just ‚Äú business as usual ‚Äù for Suleimani ) 3 . More intriguing was b ) information indicating Suleimani sought the Supreme Leader ‚Äô s approval for an operation . He was told to come to Tehran for consultation and further guidance , suggesting the operation was a big deal - but again this could be anything . 4 . And finally , a ) and b ) were read in the context of c ) Iran ‚Äô s increasingly bellicose position towards American interests in Iraq , including the attack that killed a U . S . contractor and the recent protest outside the American embassy . 5 . But as one source put it a ) + b ) + c ) is hardly evidence of an imminent attack on American interests that could kill hundreds , as the White House has since claimed . The official describes the reading of the intelligence as an illogical leap . 6 . One official described the planning for the strike as chaotic . The official says that following the attack on an Iraqi base which killed an American contractor circa Dec . 27 , Trump was presented a menu of options for how to retaliate . Killing Suleimani was the ‚Äú far out option ‚Äù 7 . Trump chose a more moderate option which involved the Dec . 29 strikes on the positions of an Iranian-backed militia . Then came the protest at the gates of the US embassy in Baghdad : <URL> 8 .
