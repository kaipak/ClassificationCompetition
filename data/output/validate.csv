"" Hearsay "" Adam Schiff Unfair Don't actually rise to an impeachable offense Shut down by the rules Blah blah blah WE DO NOT HAVE , OR KNOW OF ANY EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE so we're going to spend all day pettifogging . NOT ENOUGH TIME ! If you can't stick around for the whole day , your shorter #impeachment : 1 ) The president abused his power for personal gain . 2 ) The president obstructed Congress ' investigation of his abuse . Democratic rules guy : we need to talk about the president's behavior . He could have participated in the process . He didn't . If you've got exculpatory evidence my dudes , BRING IT . ( paraphrasing liberally ) . @USER Rules guy takes 15 sec . to say NO THE PRESIDENT DID NOT GET TO REBUT Request for unanimous consent to have a "" MANUAL ROLL CALL . "" Swatted down . Ah , and the "" since he was elected "" canard . If EVEN ONE PERSON expressed the desire to impeach , that stands for all . Dear @USER guy : it's not the #impeachment that has caused divisiveness . It's the Divider-in-Chief , and his lawlessness . His high crimes and misdemeanors , in fact . Complaining about the lack of fact witnesses is rich . Ring up @USER on that , would you pls ? @USER @USER I see that most of the seats are empty . Looks like most of the 400 - some members of the House aren't prepared to spend their whole day on this reality TV . @USER @USER "" This is about protecting the integrity of our democracy ... "" That's it , right there . Debbie Lesko gets FOUR minutes , oh my . Starts with getting away from her abusive husband . Who says irony is dead ? She's going to speak up for the abusive husband of the Executive branch . This is SO UNFAIR . NO PROOF . NONE . NOT ONE OF THE WITNESSES etc . Again , because SOMEONE , ANYONE called for #impeachment ever , "" THE WHOLE THING'S BEEN RIGGED . "" She is shrill . Sadly , she's on the wrong side of history . Ah , the "" MOST PARTISAN "" criticism . That's like the @USER insisting govt is broken . WE KNOW BECAUSE WE BROKE IT . @USER In a nutshell : "" President Trump violated the law , and solicited foreign interference in our election . "" "" The president has a pattern of escalating behavior . "" Remember Trump saying Art . 2 says he can do whatever he wants . One of the rare Trumpian words you can take as legit ."
